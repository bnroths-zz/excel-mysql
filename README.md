This little snippet allows you to copy data from excel and turn that into a MySQL query.

To install, copy the files into your directory

To run:
<ol>
<li>Copy your excel data (including header into the text box)</li>
<li>Click Create MySQL query</li>
<li>You will see a html table with your data along with the generate query</li>
<li>You can double click a cell and edit it's contents</li>
</ol>

They query is not validated but hopefully it get's most of the dirty work out of the way you can edit the rest in a text editor before you run it.
